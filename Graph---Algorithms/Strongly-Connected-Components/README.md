When you’re teaching a new subject, you often have to think about dependency among the topics you
need to cover. For example, it’s probably necessary to understand what a variable declaration is before
you start trying to learn about scope, and it’s probably necessary to understand something about
types before you can understand a variable declaration. Sometimes, there may be so much dependency
that you have some sets of topics that can’t be presented in an order that satisfies the dependency.
For example, topic A may require that you first understand B. Topic B may require that you first
understand C and C may require that you first understand A. In cases like this, the best you can do
is to try to introduce all of the topics at once during the same lecture. Your job is to write a program
that finds sets of topics like this and reports them. This way, an instructor can think ahead a bit and
try to anticipate lectures that will go a little bit long.
