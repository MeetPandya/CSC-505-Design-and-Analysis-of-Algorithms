Let’s compare string searching algorithms, including the standard string search mechanism for your
chosen programming language. Write a program called kmp.c (or kmp.cpp, kmp.java, kmp.py). This
will compare the performance of the naive, O(nm) string search algorithm, the KMP string search
algorithm and the standard string search technique for your language. We’ll say the standard way of
doing a string search is the strstr() function if you’re in C. If you’re programming in C++, we’ll say
4
it’s the find() method on stl::string. In Java, we’ll say it’s the indexOf() method on String, and in
Python, we’ll say it’s the find() method on string.
